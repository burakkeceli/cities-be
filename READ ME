Setup:

Docker uses 2 tomcat servers and 1 nginx for LB.

Before running docker-compese.yaml, either 

- dockerVolume should be saved on local and the path for the files should be changed in docker-compose.yaml.
or
- in the tomcat containers and nginx container the files should be changed with the files in dockerVolume

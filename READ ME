# Cities - BE project #

### This is BE side project of CITIES project ###
I am building a project with using new technologies which has its own continuous integration and automation.
I am having fun and learning so many things while doing it.


### These are the necessary links of this project ###
Jenkins:
http://159.65.125.11:9090/

Tomcat:
http://159.65.125.11:8081/cities/swagger-ui.html

Right now server is in DigitalOcean.
Unfortunately, I should have bought much stronger server. I will definitely increase it more.
Sometimes it is giving insufficient memory error :)


### How do I get set up? ###

* This project is working on Docker and using docker compose.
* If these are not available on the ubuntu, pls follow the instructions to setup docker, https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ and docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
* The user must be added as a docker group and must run scripts without any sudo.
* sudo groupadd docker
* sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
* (logout, login)
* docker run hello-world (just to see whether working)

* After docker installation, The script called startDockerEnvironment.sh must be started.
* If the projects is wanted to be installed on local server, then ./scripts/runTomcat.sh 8081 can be run.
* But also same can be done by jenkins inside the docker.


### Technologies, which have been used ###
* Java 8
* Postgre
* Cassandra
* Kafka
* Redis
* Jenkins


#### Note: Cities-FE can be found under project structure, but it has not been deployed to cloud yet ####
